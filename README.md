# About Me

## Introduction
Hello! I'm an enthusiastic developer with a passion for creating innovative software and tools. I enjoy working on projects that involve programming languages, system utilities, AI models, and game development. My interests span a wide range of topics, including operating systems, encryption, markup languages, and virtual machines.

## üöÄ Projects
Here are some of the key projects I've been working on:

- **ZYN-lw** - A Linux distribution that uses the Zyn language (a Nix-like configuration language in TOML format) for system management.
- **nixfetch** - A system information tool similar to `neofetch`, customized for Nix-based systems.
- **KAOL** - A custom archive format.
- **KZEV** - An encryption format based on SHA-512 with Base64 integration.
- **C::Void** - A programming language inspired by C, Rust, Perl, and Zig, featuring an interpreter and the `deck` package manager.
- **KNML (Kama's Not a Markup Language)** - A structured data format inspired by JSON, YAML, and TOML, with Protocol Buffers support and advanced data structures.
- **ZVM (Zyn Virtual Manager)** - A virtual machine manager for Windows with GUI support for loading ISOs and creating VDI files.
- **KA3D** - A 3D graphics renderer.
- **Dream League** - A game developed in Python.
- **Stackerd-math** - A stack-based shell with a unique command structure, including scripting support and an interactive game.
- **Zynx-link** - A chatbot AI in Python.
- **CodeZynx** - A coding AI model based on CodeGemma, designed for Python-only coding assistance.
- **Marx 2.0** - A web crawler that stores structured data in a custom `.msd` format.
- **Kixd** - A Nix-based programming language without a package manager.
- **CVON (C::Void Object Notation)** - A structured data format inspired by ZON, JSON, and TOML.
- **KNML** - A structured markup language that supports table structures, metadata, and nested tables.
- **A stacked window manager** - Inspired by GlazeWM, implemented in Python.
- **A 3D maze game** - Featuring raycasting techniques for rendering.
- **An anime series** - Inspired by JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
I primarily work with:
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C, Go, TypeScript, Java, Rust, Perl, Zig
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Nix, Tkinter, OpenAI API, Protocol Buffers
- **Operating Systems:** Windows 11 Pro, Linux (ZYN-lw)
- **File Formats & Standards:** JSON, TOML, YAML, GGUF, CVON

## üéØ Future Plans
I'm always exploring new ideas and technologies. Some of my future goals include:
- Enhancing my custom programming languages (C::Void, Kixd, KNML) with more powerful features.
- Improving the AI capabilities of my chatbots and coding assistants.
- Developing more advanced system utilities and encryption methods.
- Expanding my Linux distribution and package manager with better functionality.
- Creating engaging games with unique mechanics and storytelling.
